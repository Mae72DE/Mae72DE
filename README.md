# Hello, I am: Mäx
---
### … I'm interested in:
* How it works …<br>
     ... and are the instructions complete?
* Can I use my own language?<br>
      Because my English is terrible, I like to use German,<br>
      ...even if it doesn't seem any better...
* Can I use a keyboard?
     - everytime a press on ⇧ to unlook ⇩ , regadless if other Key is pressed within, too<br> - in exact behavior to the old typewriter!<br>
     - ⌥ (= AltGr) not only produces: @ € ~ | µ<br>
     Other keys also have multiple-assignments, even C64-like keycaps are unfortunately missing.

### I'm not interested …
* if I have to use the mouse at work,<br>
    it may be okay for a game!
* When I first have to search for a button.<br>
    “Where is Wally”-Generations shouldn’t create GUIs!
* If something cannot be automated,<br>
    but even more so if the manual transmission is missing!
